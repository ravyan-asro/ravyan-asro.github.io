I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) where I primarily work on hardware and algorithm co-design for machine learning in the [Systems Innovation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-innovation/) team. 
Previously, I was a full-time Research Intern in the same team as part of my undergraduate thesis. 

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India.
