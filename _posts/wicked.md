Nothing has evinced a more visceral imagery of the tug of war between identity and conformity than the Defying Gravity piece in the cultural phenomenon that is Wicked. The wickedness that resides in both Glinda and Elphaba are, perhaps, parts of us we often recognize yet more often, rather curiously, loath to acknowledge.

Glinda’s selfishness to protect her own cause over the detriment of others, even actively disparaging others to burnish her own light is conspicuously evident throughout the film. She is a placeholder most people in the theatre seats can conveniently constrain to the outlines of a bully- perhaps a bully they’ve had to endure at school, at home or the workplace. It is most straightforward, and even gratifying, to view Glinda as the *Other*, the enemy- one so distinct from oneself.
In contrast, the wickedness that lies in Elphaba is somewhat of an undercurrent, with the likeness of an elusive predator that unassumingly lies in wait underneath the surface. It is not the conventional wickedness the musical purports- the greenness of her skin, or of mannerisms, of social awkwardness, offhanded honesty or anything else that Elphaba is injudiciously persecuted for in the musical. No, her true wickedness lies elsewhere. It is the side of Elphaba that goes unnoticed, in part maybe, because most of the viewers fail to recognise a similar wickedness within themselves. Elphaba’s wickedness is revealed in her indignance at Glinda’s subservience and Glinda’s need to conform to society and to feel loved and accepted by family and friends. It is present in the unyielding unjustness of her plea to Glinda to forsake everything she had ever known, to embrace the life of an outcast for the pursuit of a “higher” moral ideal. 

In truth, Elphaba’s undoing was her own implicit conviction in her uniqueness, her quiet belief in her moral superiority. How curious it is that such a belief, though cloaked in the guise of nobility, bears the seeds of the very wickedness she would decry in others.

*Is it easier for an outcast to champion a selfless cause than for someone loved and tied down to society?*

The boundless motifs and rich aphorisms we can take away from every scene of this musical do not stop here. 

The choice between authenticity and acceptance has been depicted with an artistic forbearance as the musical begins which culminates into a burning friction by the last musical number and poses such a direct reflection of the complexities of the human condition each of us must endure, that it is physically difficult not to write of this following interpretation. 

It begins with the affrontance in the riled affecting notes of “I hope you’re happy”. The characters at this moment are separated from each other mentally and emotionally, an icy distance in values parts those who crave and desire, ultimately, the same thing. And lest it be lost on the viewers that Elphaba’s actions stem solely from advocacy of herself and others, it is explicitly shown to us during the OzDust Ball where Glinda sees through Elphaba’s heart-aching orchestration of self-love (or is it?) against social norms and realizes the depth of Elphaba’s despair, her need to belong that is masked so well by her indignance.

Striving for individuality at the expense of losing oneself in the majority, is a painful practice that rings most true for young adults in this present day. It is an unresolved struggle that has existed since the beginning of man himself. I must take some liberties now, to touch upon a personal discordance within myself, and connect it to the two characters I’d seen on screen and with time, have come to see within myself.
