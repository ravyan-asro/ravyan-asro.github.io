_This is a narrative free verse poem that won first place at the Pride and Prose contest held during UnmasQue by [Anchor BITS Pilani](https://www.instagram.com/p/CeHKyO1vtt7/?img_index=1)._

The wind was howling, and the fire was screaming
Way down in the bowels of this town.
The dark Man left, but he left behind
A mother and a child both stunted and lost.
One streaked with scars of belted pain and 
Fear of the beast in the night 
And the other, an Isaac forsaken by his Abraham
Wishing he was instead sacrificed.

And there was another Woman, she rode a
Phantom black horse and came
Blazing in the white heat of the sun
With demons of her own, and found gentle moonlight
In the mother and the boy.
The Man’s beast had crippled and warped
Their souls, but her demons held them
In the valley of her unlit heart,
Asking for retribution, instead of inflicting.
And she said to the Mother,
I’ll help you raise your boy, and give 
you bread and a roof, just for a chance,
To stand in the shadows, and look over you.

And the three built a makeshift world
For each other, giving when they were 
too shy to ask, for a hand to hold.
The restless Woman, so used to riding away 
on burning tires, and wings on fire,
Was tamed by the love of the 
Mother and the boy,
And like a sinner before the altar of Christ
She swore to come crawling back,
Back to them, and she wasn’t the Man with
Hell up his sleeve, because she always did.



The kid grew, and the memory of the Man 
With a gun in his eye, and evil in the caves
Of his heart, blurred away, as they so do 
In the young minds of child-like simplicity.
He only knew, of his Mother,
Her gentle strength and love,
And her Friend, who flew like a bat
Raptured from the inferno, who was his shield.
Both pure and good and right,
Fallen angels wronged by God.

The night was over, and at the crack of dawn,
The Boy became a righteous Man, and left
To make a family of his own, as is the way
Of humanity. 
The Mother, wrought in sadness from 
The farewell, mustered selfless felicity,
As only a Mother could.
The Woman, learnt the loss of 
A child not her own, held the other 
to share her grief.

In shining tears from a heart 
afraid of breaking, The Mother cried to 
the Woman of the night,
You need not stay, for I have learnt to
Fend for myself, and I shall not keep you
From flying away on your Phantom wings, 
To the ends of the flaming sun, like Icarus
as is your prodigal heart’s nature. 

The Woman, her dark eyes shining, 
With glimmering love so bright, told her 
Companion of long,
I know that I’ll be damned
If I don’t leave,
But I’ll be damned if I do, and your Love 
Is the bruising sun I wish 
to chase, and be worthy of, 
And to give myself in serenade, because
I’d rather be damned with you.

The nights have been too lonely, 
And the road has been too long, 
But we raised a precious love 
in this evil town.
And I’ll spar all the killers,
In the bloodshot moonlight, and I will do so,
again, just for another moment, 
Another moment,
To dance in this sinful night with you.
